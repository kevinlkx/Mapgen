We developed an integrated procedure that combines single-cell genomics with 
novel computational approaches to study genetics of complex traits. 

We first obtained high quality cell-type-resolved open chromatin regions (OCRs) 
using scATAC-seq. 
We then assessed the enrichment of genetic signals of a trait of interest 
in OCRs across all the cell types. 

Taking advantage of the enrichment results, 
we performed Bayesian statistical fine mapping on trait-associated loci, 
using a “prior” that favors likely functional variants located in 
OCRs of enriched cell types. The use of informative prior has been shown 
to improve the accuracy of fine-mapping.

The fine-mapped SNPs and its associated cell type information also 
allowed us to assign the likely cell type(s) through which the causal variants 
act in most loci. 

Finally, we developed a procedure to infer causal genes 
at each locus. Our procedure is directly informed by SNP fine-mapping, but 
instead of considering only high-confidence SNPs, 
it aggregates information of all fine-mapped variants in a locus. 

See [page](gene_mapping_procedure.html) for more details about our gene mapping procedure.
