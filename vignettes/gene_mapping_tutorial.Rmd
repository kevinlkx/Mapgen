Gene mapping procedure
=================================

Despite our fine-mapping efforts, there remains considerable uncertainty of 
causal variants in most loci. Even if the causal variants are known, 
assigning target genes can be difficult due to complex, 
often long-range, regulatory relationships between enhancers and genes.

We developed a novel gene mapping procedure to prioritize target genes:

1. For every putative causal SNP, we assign a weight to each nearby gene, 
taking into account multiple ways a SNP may affect a gene. 
The weight of a nearby gene can be viewed as the probability 
that this SNP targets that gene. 

2. The PIP of each SNP is then distributed among all potential target genes 
according to the weights of these genes. The “fractional PIP” a gene receives 
from a SNP can be viewed as the support the SNP provides to that gene. 

3. For each gene, we then sum over the fractional PIPs it receives from 
all candidate SNPs in the region. The resulting “gene PIP” approximates the 
probability of a gene being causal. 

4. Similar to variant-level fine-mapping, 
we also define a “credible gene set”, the set of genes that 
capture the causal signal at a locus with high probability (80% by default).

Gene mapping tutorial
=====================

Our gene mapping procedure takes variant-level PIPs from genetic fine-mapping 
(probability for a SNP being causal), together 
with functional annotation data, and computes gene-level PIPs 
(probability for a gene being causal).

**Required input data**:

* Fine-mapping summary statistics.
* Gene annotations, exons, introns, UTRs, etc.
* Functional annotation data, including: PC-HiC, ABC scores, open chromatin regions (OCRs), etc. 

Load R packages
```{r load-packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(GenomicRanges)
library(ggplot2)
library(mapgen)
```

Load fine-mapping results, filter SNPs with PIP threshold of 1e-5, and save as a GRanges object.
```{r load-finemapping-res}
finemapstats <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "AF.finemapping.result.rds", package = "mapgen"))
# filter SNPs and rename columns
finemapstats <- process_finemapping_sumstats(finemapstats, 
                                             snp = 'snp', chr = 'chr', 
                                             pos = 'pos', pip = 'susie_pip', 
                                             pval = 'pval', zscore = 'zscore', 
                                             cs = 'CS', locus = 'locus',  
                                             pip.thresh = 1e-5)

# For simplicity, only keep the following columns in finemapping result
cols.to.keep <- c('snp','chr','pos', 'pip', 'pval', 'zscore', 'cs', 'locus')
finemapstats <- finemapstats[, cols.to.keep]
head(finemapstats, 3)
```

Load gene annotations (hg19)
```{r load-annotations}
genomic.annots <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "genomic.annots.hg19.gr.rds", package = "mapgen"))
# gene annotations
gene.annots <- genomic.annots$genes
```

Load open chromatin regions (OCRs) 
```{r load-OCRs}
genomic.annots$OCRs <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "OCRs.hg19.gr.rds", package = "mapgen"))
```

We defined active promoters as promoters overlapping with OCRs (overlap at least 100 bp). 
```{r active-promoters}
genomic.annots$active_promoters <- IRanges::subsetByOverlaps(genomic.annots$promoters, 
                                                             genomic.annots$OCRs, 
                                                             minoverlap = 100)
```

Define enhancer loops: 

We used promoter-capture HiC (PC-HiC) data from cardiomyocytes (CMs).
```{r load-pcHiC}
pcHiC <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "pcHiC.CM.gr.rds", package = "mapgen"))
```
You can use your own PC-HiC data using process_pcHiC(). 
You may skip this if you do not have relevant PC-HiC data.

We used ABC scores from heart ventricle (from Nasser *et al.* *Nature* 2021). 
You may skip this if you do not have relevant ABC scores.
```{r process_ABC}
ABC <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "ABC.heart.ventricle.ENCODE.rds", package = "mapgen"))
# process_ABC() process a data frame of ABC scores and converts to a GRanges object.
ABC <- process_ABC(ABC, full.element = TRUE)
ABC <- ABC[ABC$gene_name %in% gene.annots$gene_name, ] # restrict to protein coding genes
```

Enhancer regions
```{r enhancer-regions}
genomic.annots$enhancer_regions <- genomic.annots$OCRs[genomic.annots$OCRs$peakType!="Promoter",]
```

Considering the fact that PC-HiC and HiC loops may miss contacts between close regions
due to technical reasons, 
we also consider enhancer regions (based on OCRs) within 20 kb of active promoters. 
```{r nearby-20kb}
nearby20kb <- nearby_interactions(genomic.annots$enhancer_regions,
                                                          genomic.annots$active_promoters, 
                                                          max.dist = 20000)
```

Include ABC, PC-HiC and nearby interactions (20kb) in the enhancer loops
```{r}
genomic.annots$enhancer_loops <- list(ABC = ABC, pcHiC = pcHiC, nearby20kb = nearby20kb)
```

Run gene mapping
===================

Parameter settings: 

* intron.mode = FALSE (do not assign intronic SNPs to the genes containing the introns).
* d0 = 50000 (distance weight parameter: 50kb by default).

```{r run-gene-mapping, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
gene.mapping.res <- compute_gene_pip(finemapstats, genomic.annots, intron.mode = FALSE, d0 = 50000)
head(gene.mapping.res)
```

Extract gene-level result table
```{r extract_gene_level_result}
gene.pip.res <- extract_gene_level_result(gene.mapping.res, gene.annots)
head(gene.pip.res)
```

Obtain 80% credible gene sets
```{r gene-cs}
gene.cs.df <- gene_cs(gene.mapping.res, by.locus = TRUE, gene.cs.percent.thresh = 0.8)
head(gene.cs.df)
```

Make a Manhattan plot of the gene PIPs, and label genes with gene PIP > 0.8.
```{r gene-manhattan-plot, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE}
gene_manhattan_plot(gene.pip.res, sig.pip = 0.8)
```
