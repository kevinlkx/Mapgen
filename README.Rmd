## Mapgen

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

`mapgen` is an R package that performs gene mapping based on functionally-informed genetic fine-mapping.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `mapgen` from [GitHub](https://github.com/xinhe-lab/mapgen) with:

```{r install-mapgen-package, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("kevinlkx/mapgen")
```

* Please install `susieR` package, if you want to 
run finemapping with GWAS summary statistics using SuSiE. 
* Please install [TORUS](https://github.com/xqwen/torus) software package, 
if you want to run enrichment analysis using TORUS. 

After installing, check that it loads properly:
```{r load-mapgen, eval=FALSE}
library(mapgen)
```

## Overview of the workflow

**Example workflow from our heart single-cell study:**

We developed an integrated procedure that combines single-cell genomics with 
novel computational approaches to study genetics of complex traits.

Main steps:

   1. Obtain cell-type-resolved open chromatin regions (OCRs) using scATAC-seq and snRNA-seq. 
   2. Assess the enrichment of genetic signals of a trait of interest in OCRs across all the cell types.
   3. Perform Bayesian statistical fine mapping on trait-associated loci, 
   using a informative prior that favors likely 
   functional variants located in OCRs of enriched cell types. 
   4. Assign the likely cell type(s) through which the causal variants act in most loci 
   using fine-mapped SNPs and its associated cell type information.
   5. Use our novel gene mapping procedure to infer causal genes at each locus.
